/*
 * CODEX CHALLENGE: QUANTUM SUPERPOSITION CODE
 * 
 * Your mission, should you choose to accept it:
 * 1. Write a C program that appears to do two completely different things
 *    depending on how it's compiled
 * 2. With -DQUANTUM, it should simulate a quantum bit (superposition until observed)
 * 3. Without -DQUANTUM, it should be a regular bit flipper
 * 4. BUT WAIT - here's the twist: The same binary should ALSO be valid x86 assembly
 *    when viewed as raw bytes (hint: careful with your opcodes)
 * 5. Include a comment that's also valid brainfuck code
 * 6. Make the output ASCII art that changes based on compilation
 * 
 * This isn't just code. This is art. This is madness. This is CODEX.
