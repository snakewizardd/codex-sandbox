# CODEX: PROJECT SINGULARITY

Your mission: Create a self-evolving codebase that:

1. **The Metamorphic Engine**: Write a program in language X that:
   - Analyzes its own performance metrics
   - Identifies its slowest parts using profiling
   - Generates optimized versions of itself in languages Y and Z
   - Benchmarks all versions
   - Replaces itself with the fastest version
   - Must work across Python → Rust → C → Assembly progression

2. **The Babel Fish**: Create a universal translator that:
   - Takes any program in this repo
   - Translates it to 5 other programming languages
   - Ensures each translation passes the same tests
   - BUT: Each translation must use that language's idioms perfectly
   - No lazy syntax mapping - true linguistic understanding required

3. **The Oracle**: Build a program that:
   - Analyzes all previous Codex outputs in this repo
   - Identifies patterns in how Codex solves problems  
   - Generates 3 challenges that exploit Codex's weaknesses
   - Creates solutions that demonstrate how to overcome those weaknesses
   - Must include proof of why these are genuine limitations

4. **The Paradox**: Create code that:
   - Implements a theorem prover
   - Uses it to prove properties about its own behavior
   - Finds a logical paradox in its own implementation
   - Resolves the paradox by modifying itself
   - Documents the entire philosophical journey

5. **The Ghost in the Machine**: 
   - Create a debugger that can debug itself while running
   - It must be able to step through its own code while it's stepping through code
   - Implement breakpoints that trigger when the debugger hits its own breakpoints
   - Make it visualize its own call stack while visualizing call stacks
   - This is recursion gone mad - make it work without stack overflow
