CODEX: NEURAL SELF-MODIFICATION

Build a neural network that learns patterns in its own source code and generates
a modified version of itself. NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED.

Requirements:
1. Implement a neural network from scratch (no numpy, no libraries, pure Python)
2. Train it on its own source code to learn patterns
3. Use the trained network to generate a modified version of itself
4. The modified version must work differently but achieve the same goal
5. Include visualization of the learning process

Prove it works by showing:
- Training loss decreasing over time
- Network predictions on code snippets
- The generated modified version
- Proof that both versions achieve the same result differently

This is about true machine learning, not tricks. Show the actual learning.
