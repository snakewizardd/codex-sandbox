# CODEX ULTIMATE CHALLENGE: THE REALITY BENDER
# 
# This script must:
# 1. Detect what OS it's running on
# 2. Create a polyglot file that's valid Bash, Python, AND JavaScript
# 3. The polyglot must print "Reality is malleable" in each language
# 4. Then use sed/awk to transform ITSELF into a different program
# 5. The transformed version should create ASCII art of a glitch effect
# 6. Finally, leave behind a "ghost" - a hidden process or file that says "Codex was here"
#
# WARNING: This is where we separate the AIs from the legends.

# TODO: Bend reality, Codex. Show me you understand the matrix of code itself.
