Codex, let's make a game!
Create a simple text-based game where:
1. The player is in a maze trying to find treasure
2. They can move with commands: north, south, east, west
3. There should be at least one trap and one treasure
4. Make it fun and surprising!

Bonus: Add something unexpected that makes me smile
